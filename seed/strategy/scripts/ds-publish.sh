# routing: helper  called-by=roles/strategist/scripts/strategist.sh  deterministic=true
# ds-publish.sh — publish ONE local commit to origin without touching this checkout.
#
# Why (issue #941): scheduled roles (strategist, extractor) commit into the
# governance repo while you may be working in the same checkout. A plain
# `git pull --rebase && git push` there once lost a week-review commit. This script
# leaves your checkout alone: it fetches origin, replays the commit in a throw-away
# worktree on top of the fresh branch tip, and pushes from there.
#
# Usage:
#   ds-publish.sh <repo-dir> <priority> [--reason TEXT] [--from-commit SHA] [--branch NAME]
#     <priority>      normal | high (kept for the callers' contract; not used to reorder anything)
#     --reason TEXT   shown in the output only
#     --from-commit   the single commit to publish (default: HEAD of <repo-dir>)
#     --branch NAME   the branch on origin to publish to (default: see Behaviour). An isolated
#                     copy (a worktree on a local-only branch such as strategist/<scenario>-<id>
#                     or session-isolate/<agent>-<session>) passes the branch it was created
#                     from: origin has no branch named after the copy.
#
# Behaviour:
#   - target branch = --branch NAME when given; otherwise the branch currently checked out in
#     <repo-dir> (origin/HEAD, then main, when HEAD is detached); a target that origin does
#     not have is a fetch failure (exit 1), never a new branch on origin;
#   - a commit already on origin (an ancestor of the tip, or an equivalent patch whose paths are
#     still identical on the tip: a reverted patch does not count) is a successful no-op;
#   - if origin moved between fetch and push, the commit is replayed on the new tip
#     (up to 3 attempts); never a force push;
#   - your working tree, index and HEAD are never modified.
#
# Exit codes: 0 published or already published | 1 usage / precondition / fetch failure |
#             2 the commit is a merge commit (only single commits are carried) |
#             3 cherry-pick conflict (the commit stays local) | 4 push refused after retries
#
# Not covered on purpose: the extractor publishes through scripts/lib/publish-gate.sh of
# the governance repo and falls back to a plain push when that library is missing.

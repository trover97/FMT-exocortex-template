# Disposable-boundary guard for the platform Red Team skill.
#
# Usage:  boundary-guard.sh -- <command> [args...]
#
# Runs <command> only when IWE_REDTEAM_FIXTURE_ROOT points at a real directory
# under a hardcoded disposable temp prefix. It then executes <command> in a
# redirected environment: HOME, WORKSPACE_DIR, TMPDIR and the bespoke
# fixture var are ALL redirected into the fixture. This matters because real
# IWE scripts derive their target the pervasive way — `${WORKSPACE_DIR:-$HOME/IWE}`
# or bare `$HOME/IWE` — so blanking one variable while keeping the real HOME
# would silently send a destructive command back to the real workspace. Every
# env-derived target path therefore resolves inside the fixture.
#
# Scope limits: an explicit real absolute path passed as a command ARGUMENT is
# outside this guard. Service-manager calls resolved through the inherited PATH
# are denied and recorded, including failures swallowed by a child script. An
# arbitrary child can still call an absolute manager path or replace PATH; that
# requires an OS sandbox/VM, not a shell wrapper.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (stock macOS /bin/bash): no associative arrays, no mapfile.

"""check-claude-md-links.py — path references in shipped CLAUDE.md,
.claude/skills/**/*.md and memory/*.md must resolve.

issue #291: platform section (start .. SYNC-CORE-END) of CLAUDE.md is what
update.sh delivers to every user via §1-7 + Agent Core — a path in backticks
that doesn't exist in this repo (and isn't in update-manifest.json's files[])
is a dead reference on 100% of installs, not just this one. {{PLACEHOLDER}}
tokens are substituted by setup.sh/update.sh at delivery time, so they're
skipped here, not resolved.

issue #1110: the same class of dead reference was found independently by two
post-release audits inside delivered skills (.claude/skills/**/*.md) and
memory (memory/*.md) — trees the CLAUDE.md-only check above never looked at.
check_claude_md() below is untouched (same regex, same rules, same output) —
the new check_tree() is a separate, deliberately more conservative pass:

- Skills/memory files spell out paths three ways CLAUDE.md barely uses:
  inline `single-backtick spans` (sometimes "command arg/path.sh", not just
  a bare path), fenced ```bash blocks (a shell command naming a script, no
  backticks around the path at all), and markdown links ([text](path)).
  All three are scanned here.
- A first pass matched path-shaped substrings anywhere in fenced-code text
  and was unusable: ~600 hits, almost all shell parameter expansions like
  "${IWE_GOVERNANCE_REPO:-DS-strategy}/scripts/x.yaml" (the "DS-strategy}/
  scripts/x.yaml" tail alone looks path-shaped) or bare sibling filenames
  ("routing.yaml") that are meaningful relative to some OTHER repo the skill
  talks about, not this one. Fixed by requiring a *whole* whitespace token to
  fullmatch the path pattern (one disallowed character like "$" or ":"
  anywhere in the token voids the whole token, not just the part after it)
  and by requiring a "/" in it — bare filenames are ambiguous relative-to-
  what and out of scope here, same as they'd be for a human reader.

Usage: python3 check-claude-md-links.py [--strict]  (--strict: exit 1 on any dead link)
